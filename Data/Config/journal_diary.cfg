@Title: Hiiiigh way to the DANGER ZONE
@Text: Revvin' up your engine\nListen to her howlin' roar\nMetal under tension\nBeggin' you to touch and go\n\nHighway to the Danger Zone\nRide into the Danger Zone\nHeadin' into twilight\n\nSpreadin' out her wings tonight\nShe got you jumpin' off the deck\nAnd shovin' into overdrive\n\nHighway to the Danger Zone\nI'll take you\nRight into the Danger Zone\n\nThey never say hello to you\nUntil you get it on the red line overload\nYou'll never know what you can do\nUntil you get it up as high as you can go\n\nOut along the edge\nIs always where I burn to be\nThe further on the edge\nThe hotter the intensity\n\nHighway to the Danger Zone\nI'm gonna take you\nRight into the Danger Zone\nHighway to the Danger Zone\nRight into the Danger Zone
