# About

Shattered Stars is a stand-alone, total-conversion mod for FreeSpace 2 Open. It is set in an original universe loosely based on the 2012 Total Recall remake.

It is a tech demo, and as such, it is still in WiP, or in development, as the mod itself is in absolutely pre-Alpha, early access, preview, unoptimized, unfinished, incomplete, not-at-all done state. It's lacking 95% of the content and assets. We are always improving the mod itself, adding the assets and ensuring its quality.

However, the game is complex enough to make sense to release it already in its current state so that we can get an idea of how good or bad it performs in the spectrum of PC configurations that is out there. That will give us directions about where to go next, or what requires most urgent attention.

# Requirements

As a standalone game, no mods or even an installation of FreeSpace is required. However, it did require the latest version of FreeSpace Open.

# How to Install

  1. Download this repository and unzip into your location.
  2. Get the latest [FSO build](http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?board=173.0) or a stable build (like 3.8.0, 3.8.2, and so on).
  3. Use wxLauncher to launch it.
